# xlmfish Website

## Overview

This repository houses the source code for the xlmfish website.  
Currently, the site is built using static HTML, but there is an ongoing plan to migrate to the [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) PHP framework.

## Project Intent

- **Upgrade to Symfony:**  
  The main goal is to transition the website from static HTML to a modern, maintainable PHP web application using Symfony.
- **User Experience:**  
  The future website will offer a more dynamic, interactive, and robust experience for users and project contributors.
- **Stellar Integration:**  
  As part of the migration, Stellar blockchain functionality will be integrated using PHP packages and Symfony components.
