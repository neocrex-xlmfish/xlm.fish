# xlmfish Website

## Overview

This repository houses the source code for the xlmfish website.  
The static HTML site has been ported to a Symfony PHP application and the repository now contains the Symfony-based implementation.

## Project Intent

- **Ported to Symfony:**  
  The static HTML site has been migrated into a Symfony project. The repo now serves templates and controllers that replace the legacy static pages.

  The Symfony-based site will offer a more dynamic, interactive, and maintainable experience for users and project contributors.
- **Stellar Integration:**  
  As part of the migration, Stellar blockchain functionality will be integrated using PHP packages and Symfony components.
